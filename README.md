### How to deploy

1. Clone this github repo
2. Install Docker
3. Prepare the docker image doing `docker compose build` or `docker-compose build`
4. Make sure the mapping of ports is correct in the `docker-compose.yaml` file

2. Connect to the instance by doing: `docker exec -it <container name> /bin/bash`
3. Run the migrations: `python3 manage.py migrate` from the geodjango directory
4. Import the data from the CSV file: `python3 manage.py loadvictims`
5. Create superuser by doing `python manage.py createsuperuser`

### How to connect with DB
